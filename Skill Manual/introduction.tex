\chapter{Introduction}


This document was originally created by R. Dawson Baker as a basis for the skills students need to excel in the ``Modern Lab'' or ``Junior Lab'' PHY 353L course at the University
of Texas at Austin. It is currently maintained by the local chapters of the Society of Physics Students and Sigma Pi Sigma, the physics honors society.
